<p>Hieronymus Lorm (1820 – 1902), native of Mikulov in Moravia – he suddenly lost his hearing ability at the age of 15 during his studies at lyceum in Vienna and at the same his sight worsened. At the beginning of his thirties he was not able to lip-read any longer. In 1882 he lost the remains of his sight. For his personal use he created a touch alphabet, by which he was able to communicate with his family as well as friends. The daughter of H. Lorm made this alphabet public six years after his death – in 1908. It had quickly spread through the whole Europe and undergone many modifications. A healthy person, who does not know the touch alphabet, may for the communication with the deafblind use a one colored fabric glove with the indication of the individual letters.

The touch alphabet for the Czech language was created by Anna Aquina Sedláčková, one of the nuns of the Saint Karel Boromejský, who performed caring and pedagogical service in the asylum for the blind in Prague, at Hradčany (Country asylum for the children sightless and sight sick). Nevertheless A. Sedláčková did not take in consideration the necessity of touch perception and orientation that allows communication of the deafblind without mistakes. Individual sounds were assembled without regard to their frequency in the Czech language.

A. Špička, director of the Country asylum for the sightless in Brno, modified the Lorm´s alphabet for the Czech language. He considered crucial a continual touch of the hands of the speaker and the receiver. He used squeeze instead of touch for touch marks with difficult perception.</p>
